# Hologram-machine
This repository contain information and files related to my hologram machine that I created with Miro Gohacki and Anna Dysinger.


This hologram machine was a construction made with a wood frame surrounding a thick clear plastic pyramid.

The wood construction would be topped with a monitor that faces downward and the monitor is connected to a raspberry pi.
- because the monitor is pointed towards the top of the clear pyramid it creates a 3D image when playing certain types of video
- It is a basic use of an optical illusion that forms a 3D looking image or hologram

The raspberry pi would run the python script included to run through the powerpoint.
- The python script calls up the powerpoint and plays through the videos in the different slides
- The machine also included a touchpad that allowed the user of the machine to swipe and change the slide of the powerpoint, then changing the hologram video
- This touchpad allowed the user to go forward or backward in the slideshow and change to through a set number and selection of hologram videos


This was a group project for CS121 or Computer Organization
- The picture uploaded was our group presenting the machine at the University of Vermont Computer Science fair
- If you look closely at that picture you can see the hologram, unfortunately, it does not appear well on camera
